This app can take [18xx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18XX) game definitions
written in json, display them, and render them for printing. The original intent
of this site was for personal PnP projects, but the purpose has shifted over
time to prototyping new games.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React
App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The application
version is created using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). The ui was
made with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).

## Chat

slack](https://join.slack.com/t/18xxgames/shared_invite/zt-8ksy028m-CSZC~G5QtiFv60_jdqqulQ).

## Usage and Documentation

Please check out the [documentation](https://www.18xx-maker.com/docs/) for
information about how to use this app to prototype your own 18xx games.
