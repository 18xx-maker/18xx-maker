# Kelsin's 18xx Prototyping React Library

This is a small pet project to help layout and print
[18xx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18XX) games.

**Important Note**: A small version of the site is up and running on
[18xx.kelsin.net](https://18xx.kelsin.net). This version only has a few games on
it. If you want to see all games included in the data files you'll need to
download the app and run it yourself (or run the public docker image). If any
designers/publishers would like to add their games to this public site just let
me know!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React
App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Donation

I've been asked about donation buttons; if you find this software useful to you
and would like to donate money towards its development you can do so via
[paypal](https://paypal.me/kelsin) or [square cash](https://cash.me/$kelsin).

## Usage

This node app uses `yarn` as it's package managing. Installing with `npm` is not
supported as I can't guaruntee proper package versions.

First install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for your operating system. I recommend using the
LTS version of node (current 10.x). The version I'm currently developing with
will always be listed in
[.node-version](https://github.com/kelsin/18xx/blob/master/.node-version).

Download the app (either using git or just downloading the zip file from
github), and then (from the folder that you downloaded into) run the following:

```sh
# Install the dependencies
yarn

# Run the app
yarn start
```

### Printing

Please check out the [docs](https://18xx.kelsin.net/docs/pdf) for how to print
pdf's from the command line.

### Board18

Please check out the [docs](https://18xx.kelsin.net/docs/b18) for information on
how to output a full board18 game box .zip file from the command line.

## Developing

### Running the site

Please check out the [docs](https://18xx.kelsin.net/docs/running) for
information on how to run the site locally to make changes.

### Adding a game

1. Copy one of the game files you feel should be closest to the game you're
   entering from the [src/data/games](src/data/games) folder. Rename it and edit it as
   much as needed.

2. In order for this new game to show up in the UI, please add it to the
   exported object in the [src/data/games/index.js](src/data/games/index.js)
   file.

3. Before opening a PR please run `yarn validate` and correct any errors.

## Docker

Please check out the [docs](https://18xx.kelsin.net/docs/running#using-docker) for
information on how to run the site locally via Docker.
