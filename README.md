This app can take [18xx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18XX) game definitions
written in json, display them, and render them for printing. The original intent
of this site was for personal PnP projects, but the purpose has shifted over
time to prototyping new games.

This project is written in [React](https://react.dev/) with
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/). It
uses [Vite](https://vite.dev/) as a build framework and
[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as a testing framework. The application version is
created using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). The ui was made with
[Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) and developed with
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). It uses
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for both testing and running a headlines
chrome in scripts.
