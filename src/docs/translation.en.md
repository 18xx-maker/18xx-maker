# 18xx Maker Translations

This tool's ui and documentation can be translated into other languages. If you are able to help translate anything please get in touch!

## UI

The source of truth for UI translations is the main
[src/locales/en.json](https://github.com/18xx-maker/18xx-maker/blob/main/src/locales/en.json)
file. If you want to make a translation into another language just submit a pull
request with this content translated to another language.

## Documentation

The documentation pages (including this one) exist as
[markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files [in the
repository](https://github.com/18xx-maker/18xx-maker/tree/master/src/docs). The
file names are in the format `<slug>.<language>.md`. The `en` language files
should be considered the source of truth. To add any other languages please
submit a pull request with other language files added.
