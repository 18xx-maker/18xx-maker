# Board18 Output

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This workflow requires you to have the source code for the app and have
> followed the instructions for [local
> development](https://github.com/18xx-maker/18xx-maker/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md).

> [!NOTE]
> I hope to get Board18 output directly in the application version of 18xx Maker
> soon.

You can output a zip file ready for Board18 by running:

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm maker b18 <game> <version> <author>
```

where `<game>` is which game to build, `<version>` is a version tag to use on
Board18 and `<author>` is the author name to use on Board18. For example, here
is me building 1889:

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm maker b18 1889 CGG01 "Christopher Giroir"
```

Remember that this will not use the options setup in the browser config page. In
order to make your printed output identical to what you see in the browser, open
the [config](?config=true) panel and copy the json found at the bottom into
`src/config.json` replacing anything previously there.

This will build the app, then output a `render/1889/board18-1889-CGG01.zip` file
as well as a bunch of files:

```
render/1889
├── board18-1889-CGG01
│   ├── 1889-CGG01
│   │   ├── Brown.png
│   │   ├── Green.png
│   │   ├── Map.png
│   │   ├── Market.png
│   │   ├── Tokens.png
│   │   └── Yellow.png
│   └── 1889-CGG01.json
└── board18-1889-CGG01.zip
```

If you want the CLI to remember your author name to avoid having to type that
you can run:

```
pnpm maker config set b18.author "<Your Name>"
```
