# 18xx Maker

18xx Maker can take 18xx game definitions written in json, display them, and
render them for printing. The original intent of this site was for personal PnP
projects, but the purpose has shifted over time to prototyping new games.

> [!TIP]
> We have a version of 18xx Maker bundled as a [desktop
> application](https://github.com/18xx-maker/18xx-maker/releases). The interface
> is the same but there is better support for file editing and more exporting
> options. If you are working on prototyping your own game we highly recommend
> you download the app.

## Partnership with Grand Trunk Games

![Grand Trunk Games Logo](/gtg.png) [Grand Trunk

supporter of print and play. They have decided to make all of their games
available on 18xx Maker as the official print and play provider! If you are able
to we highly recommend supporting this publisher by purchasing their excellent
productions of 1861/67 and Shikoku 1889!
