# Helm

This tool is usable in a number of different forms:

* A public website
* A downloadable app
* A [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) application

If you use it from the website, you can view the public games, and print their
components right from your web browser. You can also load local json files into
the site to view and print as well. You can customize the configuration options
to get games to display just the way you like them.

If you use it as an app, you can easily export full games to pdf, png and [Board
18 game boxes](https://board18.org). You can open a local json file and have the
app refresh as you edit it helping you prototype and create the games you want
to create.

If you download the source of the site you can run it locally as a
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/) application. This allows you to develop on the
application itself. This will let you add more features and options but requires
knowledge of javascript. If you do add more features please consider submitting
them back to the project to help the community. Please note that this path
requires development experience or a desire to learn!

# Goals
* Create a schema for 18xx games.
* Allow for rapid creation of a new game map and components.
* Disconnect tiles from individual games to make prototyping new games using
  existing tiles easy.
* Disconnect the definition of a game from it's look allowing game groups to
  play an existing game with the art they like.
* Provide multiple ways to output components allowing for easy external editing.
