# Company Overrides

You can now define lists of companies that you can place over the regular
companies of games. If you've ever dreamed of playing 1849 with your favorite
sports teams, or 1830 with your favorite programming languages... this is the
feature for you.

## Usage

Edit the `overrideCompanies` field in `config.json` or edit the field on the
config page. Once you do that every game you look at and print will use those
overrides. If you want to see picture logos make sure you select one of the logo
options as well!

## Examples

You can check out the lists of currently [defined
overrides](https://github.com/18xx-maker/18xx-maker/tree/master/src/data/companies). To
create new ones just create the json and then add it to the `index.js` in that
folder.

Here is an example of the 1832 Atlanda map hex with the Ruby and Python
overrides from the languages list:
