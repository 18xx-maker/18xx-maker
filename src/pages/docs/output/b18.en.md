# Board18 Output

**Important:** This workflow requires you to have the source code for the app
and have followed the instructions for local development.

_Note:_ I hope to get Board18 output directly in the application version of 18xx
Maker soon.

You can output a zip file ready for Board18 by running:

```sh
yarn build && yarn b18 <game> <version> <author>
```

where `<game>` is which game to build, `<version>` is a version tag to use on
Board18 and `<author>` is the author name to use on Board18. For example, here
is me building 1830:

```sh
yarn build && yarn b18 1830 CGG01 "Christopher Giroir"
```

Remember that this will not use the options setup in the browser config page. In
order to make your printed output identical to what you see in the browser, go
to the [config](/config) page and copy the json found at the bottom into
`src/config.json` replacing anything previously there.

This will build the app, then output a
`build/render/1830/board18-1830-CGG01.zip` file as well as a bunch of files:

```sh
build/render/1830
